A repository to track my Python learning journey 🚀
# Python Basics – Lecture 1

This repository contains my first set of Python practice problems after completing Lecture 1 of my Python course.  
I solved all 4 questions in my first try ✅

## Questions Covered
1. Write a program to input two numbers and print their sum. 
[Q1.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810905/Q1.py.py)

2. Write a program to input side of a square and print its area.
[Q2.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810907/Q2.py.py)

3. Write a program to input 2 floating point numbers and print their average.
 [Q3.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810915/Q3.py.py)
 
4. Write a program to input two numbers `a` and `b`. Print True if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, else print False.
  [Q4.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810916/Q4.py.py)

## Why this repo?
- To track my learning journey in Python.
- To share progress publicly and stay consistent.
- To look back and see how my coding skills evolve.

# LECTURE 3 – LISTS AND TUPLES IN PYTHON

In this lecture, I learned about:

- Creating and accessing list elements

- Common list methods (append, insert, remove, pop, sort, reverse, etc.)

- Introduction to tuples and their immutability

- Iterating through lists and tuples

- I also solved the following practice problems:
 
1.Program to ask the user to enter names of their favourite movies and store them in a list.
[Q1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21929841/Q1.py)

2.Program to check if a list contains a palindrome of elements.
[Q2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21929843/Q2.py)

3.Program to count the number of students with an "A" grade from a given dataset and then sort the grades from A → D.

# LECTURE 4 – SETS AND DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON

Topics Covered:

- Introduction to Sets

- Unordered collection of unique elements

- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)

- Adding and removing elements in a set

- Introduction to Dictionaries

- Key-Value pairs

- Adding, updating, and deleting dictionary entries

- Iterating over keys and values

✅ Practice Questions Solved:

Q1. Create a dictionary to store word meanings.
[Q1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21948663/Q1.py)
 
Q2. WAP to enter marks of 3 subjects from the user and store them in a dictionary. Start with an empty dictionary and add one by one with subject name as key and marks as value.
