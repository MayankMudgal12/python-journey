A repository to track my Python learning journey ðŸš€
# Python Basics â€“ Lecture 1

This repository contains my first set of Python practice problems after completing Lecture 1 of my Python course.  
I solved all 4 questions in my first try âœ…

## Questions Covered
1. Write a program to input two numbers and print their sum. 
[Q1.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810905/Q1.py.py)

2. Write a program to input side of a square and print its area.
[Q2.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810907/Q2.py.py)

3. Write a program to input 2 floating point numbers and print their average.
 [Q3.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810915/Q3.py.py)
 
4. Write a program to input two numbers `a` and `b`. Print True if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, else print False.
  [Q4.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21810916/Q4.py.py)

## Why this repo?
- To track my learning journey in Python.
- To share progress publicly and stay consistent.
- To look back and see how my coding skills evolve.

# Lecture 2 - Python Basics  
In this lecture, I learned about:  
- String concatenation  
- Length of a string  
- Indexing & slicing  
- String functions (replace, find, count, etc.)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and nesting  

## Practice Questions Solved:
1. Input userâ€™s first name and print its length.
  [Q1.py.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21821854/Q1.py.py)


3. Find the occurrence of `$` in a string.   
  [Q2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21821856/Q2.py)

5. Check if a number is odd or even.
    [Q3.py .py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21821859/Q3.py.py)
7. Find the greatest of 3 numbers entere
[Q4.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21821867/Q4.py) 

    
9. Check if a number is a multiple of 7 or not.  
[Q5.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21821873/Q5.py)

# LECTURE 3 â€“ LISTS AND TUPLES IN PYTHON

In this lecture, I learned about:

- Creating and accessing list elements

- Common list methods (append, insert, remove, pop, sort, reverse, etc.)

- Introduction to tuples and their immutability

- Iterating through lists and tuples

- I also solved the following practice problems:
 
1.Program to ask the user to enter names of their favourite movies and store them in a list.
[Q1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21929841/Q1.py)

2.Program to check if a list contains a palindrome of elements.
[Q2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21929843/Q2.py)

3.Program to count the number of students with an "A" grade from a given dataset and then sort the grades from A â†’ D.  

[Q3.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21929847/Q3.py)


# LECTURE 4 â€“ SETS AND DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON

Topics Covered:

- Introduction to Sets

- Unordered collection of unique elements

- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)

- Adding and removing elements in a set

- Introduction to Dictionaries

- Key-Value pairs

- Adding, updating, and deleting dictionary entries

- Iterating over keys and values

âœ… Practice Questions Solved:

Q1. Create a dictionary to store word meanings.
[Q1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21948663/Q1.py)
 
Q2. WAP to enter marks of 3 subjects from the user and store them in a dictionary. Start with an empty dictionary and add one by one with subject name as key and marks as value.

## ðŸ“˜ Lecture 5: Loops in Python
Today I completed Lecture 5, where I learned about `while` loops and `for` loops.  
I practiced 8 problems to strengthen my understanding of iteration and control flow in Python:

1. Countdown from 100 to 1 â†’ [Q1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057803/Q1.py)
2. Multiples of n natural numbers   
â€“10) â†’ [Q2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057819/Q3.py) 

3. Iterating over a list â†’
 [Q3.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057821/Q4.py) 


  
4. Searching a number in a tuple (while loop) â†’ 
 [Q4.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057822/Q5.py) 

5. Searching a number in a tuple (for loop with break) â†’ 
 
[Q5.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057853/Q6.py) 

   
6. Multiplication table generator â†’

 [Q6.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057855/Q7.py) 

7. Sum of first n natural numbers â†’

[Q7.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057859/Q8.py) 

8. Factorial of a number â†’ (https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057861/Q9.py) 

This session gave me clarity on:
- Difference between `for` and `while` loops
- Iterating through sequences
- Applying loops for problem solving
