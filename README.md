In this lecture, I learned about:

- Creating and accessing list elements

# LECTURE 4 ‚Äì SETS AND DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON

Topics Covered:

- Introduction to Sets

- Unordered collection of unique elements

- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)

- Adding and removing elements in a set

- Introduction to Dictionaries

- Key-Value pairs

- Adding, updating, and deleting dictionary entries

- Iterating over keys and values

‚úÖ Practice Questions Solved:

Q1. Create a dictionary to store word meanings.
[Q1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21948663/Q1.py)
 
Q2. WAP to enter marks of 3 subjects from the user and store them in a dictionary. Start with an empty dictionary and add one by one with subject name as key and marks as value.

## üìò Lecture 5: Loops in Python
Today I completed Lecture 5, where I learned about `while` loops and `for` loops.  
I practiced 8 problems to strengthen my understanding of iteration and control flow in Python:

1. Countdown from 100 to 1 ‚Üí [Q1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057803/Q1.py)
2. Multiples of n natural numbers   
‚Äì10) ‚Üí [Q2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057819/Q3.py) 

3. Iterating over a list ‚Üí
 [Q3.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057821/Q4.py) 


  
4. Searching a number in a tuple (while loop) ‚Üí 
 [Q4.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057822/Q5.py) 

5. Searching a number in a tuple (for loop with break) ‚Üí 
 
[Q5.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22057853/Q6.py)

- Applying loops for problem solving

# lecture 6 - functions and recursions

Today, I've successfully completed Lecture 6 on Python Functions and Recursion! üêç

I've applied my new skills by solving seven practice problems. Here's a brief breakdown of what each program does:

Q1.py
This program, Q1.py, defines a function named list that takes four arguments and appends them to a new list, which is then returned and printed to the console.

Q2.py
The Q2.py script defines a function single that iterates through a list and prints each item on a single line, separated by a space.

Q3.py
In Q3.py, the facto function calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop. The result is then printed.

Q4.py
The Q4.py program defines a convert function that takes a number and converts it from a hypothetical currency to Indian Rupees (INR) using a fixed exchange rate.

Q5.py
Q5.py contains a function called number that determines whether a given integer is even or odd using the modulo operator.

Q6.py
This script, Q6.py, demonstrates recursion. The sum function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 up to a given number by calling itself repeatedly.

Q7.py
The Q7.py program also showcases recursion. The elements function iterates through a list and prints each element by calling itself with an incremented index until it reaches the end of the list.

 
# lecture 7 - File I/O

- Key Concepts learned and Practiced:

Reading and Writing Files: I learned how to open files in different modes (e.g., read, write) to perform operations like reading the entire content or writing new data. I also practiced using the 


with statement to ensure files are properly closed, even if errors occur.


String Manipulation: The exercises involved using string methods like replace() to modify file content, and find() to locate specific substrings.

Iterating Through Files: I implemented a solution that reads a file line by line using a while loop and readline() to find a specific word and its corresponding line number.


Data Processing: One of the problems required me to read a file containing a comma-separated list of numbers, split the string into individual values, and then process them to count how many were even. This task helped me practice converting string data to integers and performing conditional checks.

Project Structure:
Q1.py: Demonstrates how to write a string to a file named practice.txt.

Q2.py: Reads the content of practice.txt, replaces the word "java" with "python," and then writes the updated content back to the file.

Q3.py: Finds the starting index of the word "learning" in practice.txt.

Q4.py: Searches practice.txt for the word "learning" and prints the line number where it's first found.

Q5.py: Reads numbers from numbers.txt, counts the even numbers, and prints the total count.

How to Run:
Clone this repository.

Ensure you have the practice.txt and numbers.txt files (included in the repository) in the same directory as the Python scripts.

Run each Python script from your terminal (e.g., python Q2.py).
